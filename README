A collection of scripts use during machine learning experiments. All
highly experimental.

grid.py

A modified version of libSVM's grid.py script. The original can be found in the
'tools' directory in any distribution of libSVM:

machines. ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology,

This modified version allows optimizing on different criteria than accuracy.
Optimizing on accuracy could cause problems with unbalanced data, where the
classifier would achieve higher scores by binning everything into the majority
class. Using F-measures should counter this problem.

This mod also has some REDUCED FUNCTIONALITY compared to the original.
Specifically, it does not support SSH or Telnet workers, multiple local
workers are also not supported as using more than one worker would invariably
result in segfaults or illegal instruction errors. If you wish to use these
functions, please use the original grid.py.
