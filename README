A collection of scripts use during machine learning experiments. All
highly experimental.

grid.py
--------------------
A modified version of libSVM's grid.py script. The original can be found in the
'tools' directory in any distribution of libSVM:
http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/

Reference:
Chih-Chung Chang and Chih-Jen Lin, LIBSVM : a library for support vector
machines. ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology,
2:27:1--27:27, 2011.
Software available at http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm

This modified version allows optimizing on different criteria than accuracy.
Optimizing on accuracy could cause problems with unbalanced data, where the
classifier would achieve higher scores by binning everything into the majority
class. Using F-measures should counter this problem.

This mod also has some REDUCED FUNCTIONALITY compared to the original.
Specifically, it does not support SSH or Telnet workers, multiple local
workers are also not supported as using more than one worker would invariably
result in segfaults or illegal instruction errors. If you wish to use these
functions, please use the original grid.py.

--------------------
crossValidate.py
--------------------
Takes a directory containing instance files as generated by 
styleneFolding.py (see https://github.com/frederik-vaassen/styleneTools)

	[data_folder]
		\_ fold-01
			\_ train
				\_ svm
					\_ N_GRAM_TOKEN_1.TotalSet.ngrams.txt
			\_ test
				\_ svm
					\_ N_GRAM_TOKEN_1.TotalSet.ngrams.txt
		\_ fold-02
			\_ train
				\_ svm
					\_ N_GRAM_TOKEN_1.TotalSet.ngrams.txt
			\_ test
				\_ svm
					\_ N_GRAM_TOKEN_1.TotalSet.ngrams.txt
		\_ ...

and runs n-fold cross-validation using libSVM or libLinear. Displays
statistics using confusionmatrix.py (see above).
		
The pattern which instance filenames have to match to be processed can
be specified using the -i option. By default, this pattern is 
N_GRAM_TOKEN_?1.TotalSet.ngrams.txt

The -r option allows you to specify a mapping between the class labels
specified in the instance files, and the classes you actually want to
train and test on. This mapping takes the form of an XML file:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mapping>
	<remap source="1.0" dest="low" />
	<remap source="2.0" dest="low" />
	<remap source="3.0" dest="high" />
	<remap source="4.0" dest="high" />
</mapping>

Usage:
--------------------
python crossValidate.py instance_folder (options)

Takes a folder of Stylene train and test instance files (as structured by
styleneFolding.py) as input. Trains and tests each fold, remapping classes
if specified.

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i PATTERN, --instance-pattern=PATTERN
                        Specify the file name of the instance files you want
                        to use, can be a regex pattern. (Default:
                        N_GRAM_TOKEN_?1.TotalSet.ngrams.txt)
  -o OUTPUT_FOLDER, --output-folder=OUTPUT_FOLDER
                        Specify the folder you want model files and
                        predictions to be stored. (Default: instance_folder
                        /fold-XX/)
  -c CLASSIFIER, --classifier=CLASSIFIER
                        Specify the classifier you want to use. (Available:
                        'libsvm' (default), 'liblinear')
  -p PARAMETERS, --params=PARAMETERS
                        Specify the parameters for the classifier. Separate
                        keys and values with a colon, and different parameters
                        with a dash. (Default: 'c:512-g:8')
  -r REMAP_FILE, --remap-file=REMAP_FILE
                        Specify the location of the XML file containing a
                        class remapping. (Default: None)
