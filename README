A collection of scripts use during machine learning experiments. All
highly experimental.

confusionmatrix.py was written by Vincent Van Asch. See the following

This modified version allows optimizing on different criteria than accuracy.
Optimizing on accuracy could cause problems with unbalanced data, where the
classifier would achieve higher scores by binning everything into the majority
class. Using F-measures should counter this problem.

Only works with local workers so far.
